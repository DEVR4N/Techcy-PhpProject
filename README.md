# CMPE483 - Internet Programming II
Techcy project is a simple php-mysql based shopping project. It does not include any framework. Made for homework.
There is a database in it, you can import it into phpmyadmin. 
Update-Delete commands are not available, I could not spare time due to technical problems, but they can be added with a simple effort.
I hope it will be helpful.
